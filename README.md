## Usage and Installation Notes
### Usage
You can view the tutorial materials using the excellent service from [Binder]. Click in the Binder bagde [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)][binder_lab] to play with the notebooks from your
browser without installing anything or you can setup a [local instalation](#local-instalation).

> [Overleaf] lets you easily host interactive Jupyter notebooks and let anyone on the internet use them interactively immediately! Binder creates executable environment making your code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.

You can [visualize the notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/emanuelfontelles/algorithmDataStructure) without running any kernel.

### Local Instalation

### Downloading the Tutorial Materials
I would highly recommend using [git], not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone git://github.com/emanuelfontelles/algorithmDataStructure.git

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.  I may make minor changes to
the repository in the days before the tutorial, however, so cloning the
repository is a much better option.
